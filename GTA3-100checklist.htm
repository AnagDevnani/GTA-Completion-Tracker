<h1>GTA3 100% Completion Checklist</h1>

<h3>
Notes
</h3>

<h4>
Several missions that contribute to 100% completion can be permanently disabled if other missions are completed beforehand:
</h4>

<li>
Luigi's mission "The Fuzz Ball" must be completed before Salvatore's "Last Requests".
</li>
<li>
Joey's mission "The Getaway" must be completed before Salvatore's "Last Requests".
</li>
<li>
Kenji's mission "Smack Down" must be completed before Donald Love's "Waka-Gashira Wipeout!"
</li>
<li>
Asuka's mission "Two-Faced Tanner" must be completed before Donald Love's mission "Grand Theft Aero".
</li>

<h4>
As the player progresses through the storyline, multiple gangs will become hostile to Claude or have their weaponry upgraded, making vehicle missions and Rampages extremely difficult. It is heavily advised to complete:</h4>

<li>
All Portland vehicle missions and Rampages before "The Pick-Up" and "Trial By Fire" (where the Triads become hostile after one is completed), "Sayonara Salvatore" (after which the Mafia become hostile and begin carrying Pump Shotguns), "Uzi Rider" (where the Diablos become hostile)
</li>
<li>
All Staunton Island vehicle missions and Rampages before "Kingdom Come" (where the Yardies become hostile), although the Colombian Cartel are hostile from the start of the game (but won't typically be encountered in open play until after "Last Requests")
</li>
<li>
All Shoreside Vale vehicle missions and Rampages before the final mission "The Exchange" (where the Colombian Cartel replace Pistols with Uzis and AK-47s).
</li>
